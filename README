This application requires Python Tornado and GStreamer. It serves 
live video feed into my home aquarium.

The video itself comes from a Raspberry Pi with an attached webcam. The
video feed is already encoded in H.264 and arrives via an RTP/TCP 
stream created by GStreamer on the Raspberry Pi.

The code running on the Raspberry Pi still needs to be cleaned up and
will be added here soon.  Also, the Pi's IP address and port numbers
are currently hard-coded in constants.py.  This could be improved upon
by a negotation scheme where the Pi can connect its video stream as a
client. We'll see when I get time to do that...

You can execute this server by running:

python streamer.py

... logs will appear on stdout.
